Learning Journal Assignment - CF 401 Python, Week3.

Day 1 (branch step1):
Use the [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) starter template to create a basic Learning Journal application.

In order to complete this assignment, we established the following routes and views in Pyramid:

* "/" : The home route, serving index.html.
* "/journal/entry" : Currently serving the single completed journal entry.  This will be updated to serve journal entries dynamically.
* "/journal/new-entry" : Serves the form template for creating a new journal entry.
* "/journal/edit": Serves the form template for editing an existing entry.  This will be updated to dynamically operate on a single entry.

# Goals for tomorrow:
 * Write tests
 * Fix static file references
